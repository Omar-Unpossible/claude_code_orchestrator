#
# This file demonstrates all available configuration options with extensive comments.
# Copy this to config/config.yaml and customize for your environment.
#
# Configuration Precedence (highest to lowest):
# 1. Command-line arguments
# 2. Environment variables (ORCHESTRATOR_* prefix)
# 3. Explicit config path
# 4. User config (~/.orchestrator/config.yaml)
# 5. Project config (./config/config.yaml)
# 6. Profile config (./config/profiles/{profile}.yaml)
# 7. Default config (./config/default_config.yaml)
#
# All sections are optional and will use defaults from default_config.yaml if omitted.

# ============================================================================
# LOCAL LLM CONFIGURATION (Ollama)
# ============================================================================
#
# Configures the local LLM for validation and quality scoring.
# Used by QualityController, ConfidenceScorer, and DecisionEngine.
#
# Note: LLM location is INDEPENDENT of agent location (M8 architecture).
# - Agent (Claude Code) can be local or remote
# - LLM (Ollama) is always on host machine for GPU access
#
llm:
  # LLM provider type (must match LLMRegistry)
  type: ollama

  # Model to use for inference
  # Options:
  #  - qwen2.5-coder:32b    # 32B model (recommended, best quality)
  #  - qwen2.5-coder:14b    # 14B model (faster, lower quality)
  #  - qwen2.5-coder:7b     # 7B model (fast, minimal quality)
  model: qwen2.5-coder:32b

  # API endpoint for Ollama service
  # Examples:
  #  - http://172.29.144.1:11434   # Host machine (recommended for VM)
  #  - http://localhost:11434      # Local machine
  #  - http://192.168.1.100:11434  # Network address
  api_url: http://172.29.144.1:11434

  # Temperature for generation (controls randomness)
  # Range: 0.0 (deterministic) to 2.0 (highly random)
  # Recommended: 0.7 (balanced)
  # Lower for validation tasks (more consistent)
  # Higher for creative tasks
  temperature: 0.7

  # Timeout for LLM generation (seconds)
  # Large complex prompts may need longer timeouts
  # Recommended: 30-120 seconds
  timeout: 30

  # Maximum tokens to generate per response
  # Larger = more verbose responses but slower
  # Recommended: 4096 (good balance)
  max_tokens: 4096

  # Model context window size (tokens)
  # Must match the actual model capacity
  # Qwen 2.5 Coder: 32768 tokens
  context_length: 32768


# ============================================================================
# AGENT CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
#
# Configures how Claude Code is executed. Two modes are supported:
#
# 1. LOCAL (recommended for same-machine deployment)
#    - Runs Claude Code in subprocess with headless mode (--print flag)
#    - Fresh session per call for 100% reliability
#    - No PTY (known issues with terminal emulation)
#    - Automatic permission bypass (dangerous mode)
#
# 2. SSH (for remote execution)
#    - Runs Claude Code on remote machine via SSH
#    - Persistent agent connection
#    - More network overhead
#    - Requires SSH key configuration
#
agent:
  # Agent type to use
  # Options:
  #  - claude-code-local    # Local subprocess (recommended - M8)

  #  - claude-code-docker   # Docker container (future)
  type: claude-code-local

  # Global agent timeout (seconds)
  # Used if agent-specific timeout not set
  # Recommended: 120 (2 minutes) for quick tasks
  # Increase for long-running tasks (300-600)
  timeout: 120

  # Maximum retry attempts on failure
  # Each retry uses backoff (exponential)
  # Recommended: 2-3
  max_retries: 3

  # Agent workspace directory
  # Must exist and be writable
  # Claude Code will work in this directory

# ============================================================================
# CONTEXT WINDOW MANAGEMENT (M5)
# ============================================================================
#
# Manages context history and thresholds for compression.
#
# Context Window Lifecycle:
# 1. Task starts, context window ~20% full (task description, initial context)
# 2. Each iteration adds response + validation (window grows)
# 3. At 70% (warning): Log warning, consider summarization
# 4. At 80% (refresh): Begin compressing old context
# 5. At 95% (critical): Aggressive compression or new session
#
# Thresholds are percentages (0.0-1.0) of model.context_length
# Example: context_length=32768, warning_threshold=0.70 -> 22937 tokens
#
context:
  # Maximum total tokens for context in prompts
  # This is per-iteration limit, not total limit
  # Limits how much history is included
  # Recommended: 8000 (good balance for Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B)
  # Rules:
  #  - Must be <= model.context_length
  #  - Larger = more context but slower
  #  - Smaller = faster but less history
  max_tokens: 8000

  # Context window threshold configuration
  # Used by ContextManager to decide when to compress/summarize
  #
  # These are percentages of the model context window (0.0-1.0)
  # Examples based on context_length=32768:
  #  - 0.70 = 22937 tokens (warning)
  #  - 0.80 = 26214 tokens (refresh)
  #  - 0.95 = 31130 tokens (critical)
  #
  thresholds:
    # Warning threshold: Start monitoring memory pressure
    # Recommendations:
    #  - Typical: 0.70 (good balance)
    #  - Conservative: 0.60 (more frequent monitoring)
    #  - Aggressive: 0.80 (less overhead)
    # Rule: Must be < refresh and < critical
    warning: 0.70

    # Refresh threshold: Begin context summarization
    # Start compressing and summarizing old context
    # Recommendations:
    #  - Typical: 0.80
    #  - Conservative: 0.70
    #  - Aggressive: 0.85
    # Rule: Must be > warning and < critical
    refresh: 0.80

    # Critical threshold: Aggressive compression or new session
    # If this is reached, consider terminating iteration
    # Recommendations:
    #  - Typical: 0.95
    #  - Conservative: 0.90
    #  - Aggressive: 0.99
    # Rule: Must be > warning and > refresh

    - task_description     # Current task
    - relevant_files       # Files mentioned

  # Context summarization when limit reached
  summarization:
    # Enable context summarization
    # When true: Summarizes old context to free space
    # When false: Uses other compression strategies
    enabled: true

    # Number of recent interactions to keep unsummarized
    # Recent interactions are kept in full for accuracy
    # Older ones are summarized
    # Recommended: 5 (keep last 5 interactions, summarize rest)
    keep_recent: 5

# COMMON CONFIGURATION SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================
#
# Quick reference for common setups:
#
# SCENARIO 1: Quick Development Testing
# - Use minimal validation
# - Short timeouts
# - Verbose logging
# Modify: validation.quality.threshold=30, agent.timeout=60, logging.level=DEBUG
#
# SCENARIO 2: Production Deployment
# - Strict validation
# - Longer timeouts
# - Minimal logging
# Modify: validation.quality.threshold=80, agent.timeout=300, logging.level=WARNING
#
# SCENARIO 3: Complex Task Processing
# - Extended timeouts
# - Adaptive max_turns
# - Context summarization enabled
# Modify: agent.timeout=600, max_turns.adaptive=true, context.summarization.enabled=true
#
# SCENARIO 4: Remote Agent Setup
# - Change agent.type to claude-code-ssh
# - Configure SSH credentials
# - Set up network connectivity
# Modify: agent.type=claude-code-ssh, agent.ssh.host=remote.host, agent.ssh.user=claude
#
# SCENARIO 5: Autonomous Mode
# - Enable dangerous mode
# - High confidence threshold
# - No breakpoints
# Modify: agent.local.bypass_permissions=true, confidence.threshold=60, breakpoints.enabled=false

# ============================================================================
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE OVERRIDES
# ============================================================================
#
# Any config value can be overridden via environment variables.
# Format: ORCHESTRATOR_SECTION_KEY=value
#
# Examples:
#
#   Override agent timeout:
#   export ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT_TIMEOUT=300
#
#   Override LLM model:
#   export ORCHESTRATOR_LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:14b
#
#   Override database URL (RECOMMENDED for secrets):
#   export ORCHESTRATOR_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db
#
#   Override SSH key path (RECOMMENDED for security):
#   export ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT_SSH_KEY_PATH=/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519
#
# Precedence: Environment variables override all config files!
# This is useful for:
# - Secrets (passwords, API keys, SSH keys)
# - Machine-specific settings (hosts, ports, paths)
# - Runtime overrides (timeouts, log levels)
#
# Best Practice: Use environment variables for sensitive data!
