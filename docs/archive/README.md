## Archive Organization

### `/milestones/`
**Old milestone completion summaries (M1-M9)**

These milestones have been superseded by the PHASE-based implementation approach (LLM-First Prompt Engineering Framework). The project has evolved from the original M0-M9 milestone structure to a more focused PHASE-based approach.

**Archived Files**:
- `M1_PROGRESS.md` - Early M1 progress (superseded by M1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md)
- `M2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - M2 LLM & Agent Interfaces completion
- `M4_PROGRESS.md` - Early M4 progress (superseded by M4_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md)
- `M4_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - M4 Orchestration Engine completion
- `M5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - M5 Utility Services completion
- `M6_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - M6 Integration & CLI completion
- `M7_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - M7 Testing & Deployment completion
- `M8_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - M8 Local Agent Implementation completion
- `M9_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - M9 Parameter Optimization completion
- `CLEANUP_V1_SUMMARY.md` - Early cleanup effort summary
- `HEADLESS_MODE_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Headless mode implementation (now part of M8)
- `POST_CLEANUP_VALIDATION.md` - Post-cleanup validation results

**Why Archived**: These milestones have been completed and their work has been integrated into the main codebase. The current focus is on PHASE-based development (LLM-First framework).

**Archived Files**:
- `obra-technical-design.md` - Original technical design
- `obra-technical-design-enhanced.md` - Enhanced technical design
