## Slide 2: The Problem

# **Enterprises are drowning in LLM orchestration overhead**

### Three Critical Pain Points:

**Developer Time Waste**
- 20-40% of time spent on prompt engineering, not building
- 8.3 iterations per feature component on average
- Constant context switching and manual testing

**Exploding API Costs**
- $1,000-$5,000/month per heavy AI user
- Teams of 50 developers: $50k-$250k/month in LLM costs
- 3-5% month-over-month growth

**No Turnkey Solution**
- Existing tools are IDE assistants, not orchestration platforms
- Every team reinvents the wheel for LLM workflows
- Engineers becoming prompt operators instead of product builders

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

# **Obra is the orchestration layer between developers and LLMs**

### What Obra Does:

**Automates** prompt generation based on project context and standards

**Orchestrates** validation loops using local reasoning models

**Manages** testing and integration automatically

**Learns** from your codebase to enforce patterns

**Operates hybrid:** Local LLM for reasoning (cheap), remote LLMs for generation (quality)

### The Result:
**Developer expresses intent → Obra delivers tested, integrated features → Developer approves and ships**

---

## Slide 4: Value Proposition

# **Three Value Props for Three Buyers**

### For Development Teams:
> "Reduce your LLM API costs by 60-75% while shipping features 40-60% faster through automated AI orchestration"

### For CTOs/Engineering Leaders:
> "Enterprise-grade LLM workflow platform that learns your codebase, enforces standards, and eliminates prompt engineering overhead—deployed on your infrastructure"

### For Compliance/Security-Conscious Orgs:
> "Hybrid architecture keeps sensitive code local while leveraging remote LLMs only for generation—full data sovereignty with AI acceleration"

## Slide 5: How It Works

# **The Obra Orchestration Loop**

```
Developer Intent
    ↓
Obra Planning (Local)
    ↓
Remote LLM Generation
    ↓
Obra Validation (Local)
    ↓
Automated Testing
    ↓
Integration or Refinement Loop
    ↓
Human Approval → Ship
```

### Key Innovation: Hybrid Architecture
- **25% remote LLM** (high-quality generation)
- **75% local LLM** (reasoning, validation, caching)
- **vs. 100% remote** in standard workflows

**Average iterations: 2.1** (vs. 8.3 industry baseline)

## Slide 10: Why Now?

# **Three Convergences Enable Obra Today**

### 1. LLM Capability Threshold (2024-2025)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o cross "production-ready" bar
- Error rates <15% for well-prompted tasks
- 200k+ token context windows handle entire codebases

### 2. Local Model Viability (2024)
- Llama 3.1 70B, Qwen 2.5 72B rival GPT-3.5 at 1/100th cost
- Consumer GPUs (RTX 4090) run 70B models at usable speeds
- Local deployment is now technically AND economically feasible

### 3. Enterprise Cost Pressure (2025)
- LLM API budgets grew 300% YoY in 2024
- CFOs demanding ROI on AI investments
- "Tool sprawl" problem: 5-10 AI tools without integration

**Window:** 18 months before incumbents add orchestration or enterprises build internal solutions

## Slide 14: Risks & Mitigations

# **Key Risks and How We Address Them**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **LLM quality improves, reducing need for validation** | Shift focus to workflow optimization, codebase knowledge, team pattern enforcement |
| **Incumbents (GitHub, Cursor) add orchestration** | 12-18 month head start; focus on compliance, data sovereignty, cost optimization |
| **Customers build internal solutions** | Building costs $500k+/year vs. $180k/year for Obra; continuous workflow updates |
| **Adoption slower than expected** | Alpha de-risks; pivot to consulting → SaaS; diversified GTM |
| **Local LLM inference too expensive** | Customer provides hardware; appliance includes hardware in price; ROI works at 2x cost |
